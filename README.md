## **üìñ Description**

LinPy is a Python package that demonstrates a deep understanding of linear algebra concepts through practical implementation. Unlike typical projects that rely on libraries like NumPy, LinPy is built using Python's built-in lists to perform vector and matrix operations, showcasing both theoretical knowledge and practical coding skills.


Limitations:
- only int|float components for Vector/Matrix instances are allowed.
- Vectors can only be 1D -> shape = (n,)
- Matrix can only be 2D -> shape = (n, m)
