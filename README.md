# LinPy
Portfolio Repository : A repository that showcases my knowledge in Linear Algebra.

Limitations:
- only int|float components for Vector/Matrix instances are allowed.
- Vectors can only be 1D -> shape = (n,)
- Matrix can only be 2D -> shape = (n, m)

## Structure
The structure of the project is following:
1. BaseTools.py - provide a basic functionality to create Vector() or Matrix() , etc . The same as np.array().
2. VectorTools.py - provide methods created specifically for vector operations, like is_basis() or calculate_linear_combination()
3. MatrixTools.py - provide methods created specifically for matrix operations, like is_linear_transformation(), or compose_transformation()

The Base Tools contain classes contain methods that use ready optimized solutions, whereas MAtrixTools and VectorTOols.py scripts use the same functions but from scratch. THis proves the deep understanding of both theorical and practical sides of the concept
